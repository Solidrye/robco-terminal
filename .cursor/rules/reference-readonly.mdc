# Reference folder: read-only

The **`_reference/`** directory (including `_reference/robco-terminal-main/`) is the original fork reference. It must **never** be modified, overwritten, or written to.

- **Do**: Read shader values, CRT/visual settings, and rendering logic from the reference when aligning behavior or restoring defaults.
- **Do not**: Edit, delete, or create files under `_reference/`. Do not run scripts or commands that write into `_reference/`.

All changes and new code belong in the main project tree (e.g. `src/`), not in the reference folder.
